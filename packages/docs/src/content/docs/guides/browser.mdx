Jimp can be used anywhere that javascript is supported. It can be used in the browser, in Node.js, or in a web worker.

## Usage

There are two main ways to use Jimp in the browser.

### With hosted file

You can initialize a Jimp instance from a URL or a file path.

```ts
import Jimp from "jimp";

// Read a file hosted on the same domain
const image1 = await Jimp.read("/some/url")

// Read a file hosted on a different domain 
const image2 = await Jimp.read("https://some.other.domain/some/url")
```

### With uploaded files

Or you can use Jimp with an `ArrayBuffer`.
Here we take a user's uploaded image and modify it to greyscale.

```ts
function handleFile(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
  const reader = new FileReader();

  reader.onload = async (e) => {
    const image = await Jimp.fromBuffer(e.target?.result);

    image.greyscale();

    const base64 = await image.getBase64("image/jpeg")
  };

  reader.readAsArrayBuffer(e.target.files[0]);
}

input.addEventListener("change", handleFile); 
```

## Setup

For the most part Jimp's code can be used in the browser. However, there are a few things to be aware of.

The `Buffer` class is not available in the browser.
You will need to polyfill this however the bundler you're using will handle this for you.

### `webpack`

To do this in `webpack` you can use the `resolve.fallback` option.

```js
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      buffer: require.resolve('buffer/'),
    },
  },
};
```

### `vite` / `astro`

To do this in `vite` you can use the `resolve.alias` option.

```js
import { NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin } from "@esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill";

export default defineConfig({
  esbuildOptions: {
    define: {
      global: "globalThis",
    },
    plugins: [NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin({ buffer: true })],
  },
});
```
